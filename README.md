stella-libretro
========================

Fork of Port of Stella to libretro for multicore sf2000 with remapped controls.

Because Start + Select is the sf2000 menu hotkey , it Resets the atari 2600 games , so i remapped the controls in this fork.

L = SELECT

R = RESET

Y = Black/White 

A = Color


Just download the the latest release and overwrite <strong>a26</strong> folder in your <strong>SDCARD:\cores</strong>
